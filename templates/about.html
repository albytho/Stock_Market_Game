  <h1>Hello World, I'm Alby Thomas.</h1>
  <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor studying CS.  This website is a little side project I did to get some practice using <b><u>python flask</u></b> and <b><u>MongoDB</u></b>.  Because I'm just starting flask, please excuse any weird bugs you catch as you play around with this.  Thanks!<p>
